# Foundations Reflection

The foundations phase of this bootcamp changed how I think about learning and engineering. Unlike college, where learning is theory-heavy and exam-driven, this phase was practice-focused and habit-driven. I learned that real growth happens through repetition, debugging, and small daily progress.

The Motivation module helped me shift from a passive learning mindset to an active one. Instead of waiting to “fully understand” something before trying, I now follow the cycle: try → break → fix → improve. I also learned the importance of asking better questions by providing context and explaining what I already tried.

The Desktop and Environment Setup module made me comfortable with Linux and the command line. Creating a clean folder structure (`~/work`, `~/notes`, `~/bin`) gave me a sense of organization and discipline. I understood why Unix-like systems are preferred in professional environments.

Through Git and Shell modules, I became confident using version control and terminal commands daily. I learned that Git tracks files, not folders, and that small, consistent commits are better than large, rushed ones. Working from the CLI no longer feels intimidating.

Computing Basics and Server Setup introduced me to processes, ports, permissions, SSH, and cloud VMs. Setting up an Oracle Cloud instance and connecting via SSH made me realize how real production systems operate. Creating a non-root user and installing tools felt like stepping into professional engineering practice.

The VS Code, Documentation, and Data modules strengthened my workflow. I now rely on formatting tools, Markdown, Mermaid diagrams, JSON/YAML understanding, and proper configuration separation (.env vs code). I understand that JSON is for machines and YAML is for humans.

Most importantly, the Workflow Habits module helped me build a structured learning system. I now keep organized notes, break large problems into smaller steps, and use LLMs responsibly — as assistants for clarification, not replacements for thinking.

Overall, this foundations phase gave me confidence in tools, discipline in workflow, and clarity in mindset. I now feel ready to move into TypeScript and application development with a strong base.
