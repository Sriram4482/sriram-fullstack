# Computing Basics Notes

- A process is a running program. I can see processes using `ps` and stop them using `kill`.
- File permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file. Without execute permission, scripts cannot run.
- Ports are used by servers to listen for requests. Only one process can use a port at a time.
- Errors like "address already in use" mean another process is already using that port.
- Using `sudo` unnecessarily is dangerous because it bypasses safety checks and can damage the system.
