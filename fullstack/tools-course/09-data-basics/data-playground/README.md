# Data Playground

This folder demonstrates common data formats used in real projects.

- JSON: Used for APIs and machine communication
- YAML: Used for human-readable configuration
- CSV: Used for tabular datasets
- .env: Used for secrets and environment-specific values

Rule:
JSON is for machines. YAML is for humans.
Secrets should never be committed.
